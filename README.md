Fitness App

Problem Statement:

Many People due to huge workloads have a high prevalence of physical inactivity and high rates of preventable health conditions, including obesity and cardiovascular disease. Many fitness and wellness organizations do not know how to effectively increase their fitness and wellness. Mobile Applications can help them to keep track of their health and workouts. Technology can help to manage our time accordingly to our schedule.

Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a “Fitness App” to keep track of their health records and help them to maintain their diet.
Calorie Counter Fragment is to provide a way for users to register what they have eaten throughout the day and track at what time they ate to ensure that users know what they are eating to promote healthier living. The recipe is to provide users with some good recipes so that they can easily follow and learn how to make healthy foods. Weight Progress is to allow users to track their weight by entering logs into the dieting app. Exercise is to let the users know about the recommended exercise they must be doing to reduce the weight, increase the weight, or maintain their body diet. Notification is to allow the user to schedule a notification to remind them what times they should eat.

Functionality & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface.
Kotlin was used to make all the files associated with the calorie fragment. Here are a few of the major tools we used to implement the app.

- App Navigation was used to switch between different screens.
- Constraint Layout was used by most of the activities which are easy to handle for different screen sizes.
- Room Database was used to implement the food diary and record tracker part of the app.
- Data binding was used to implement most of the fragments that were part of the MVVM architecture part of the app.
- RecyclerView was used to implement Record Tracker and Food Diary.


Application Link & Future Scope :

The app is currently updating some more features as per SDLC Model.
- You can access the app: https://github.com/Harsh-Vasoya/Fitness-App.git

Once the App is ready after multiple testing and patches, we want to launch publicly and manage it on google cloud. We are also planning to add an AI system like a chatbot. We also want to add an expert talk feature.
